**Abstract:**   
The objective of this study is to develop a model of the cardiovascular system
capable of simulating the short-term (< or = 5 min) transient and steady-state
hemodynamic responses to head-up tilt and lower body negative pressure. The
model consists of a closed-loop lumped-parameter representation of the
circulation connected to set-point models of the arterial and cardiopulmonary
baroreflexes. Model parameters are largely based on literature values. Model
verification was performed by comparing the simulation output under baseline
conditions and at different levels of orthostatic stress to sets of
population-averaged hemodynamic data reported in the literature. On the basis
of experimental evidence, we adjusted some model parameters to simulate
experimental data. Orthostatic stress simulations are not statistically
different from experimental data (two-sided test of significance with
Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons). Transient response
characteristics of heart rate to tilt also compare well with reported data. A
case study is presented on how the model is intended to be used in the future
to investigate the effects of post-spaceflight orthostatic intolerance.
